The goal of {ihpdexcel} is to provide excel-reports for the exubernace indicators, 
for the International Housing Observatory. It sources an excel template from the `template` dir and store the output to `versions` dir. It  utilizes the api from `{ihpdr}`, to download and tidy data, so there is no need to fetch data manually. You simply need to source
the `create-excel.R` file.

```{r warning=FALSE}
source("create-excel.R")
```

# Download
