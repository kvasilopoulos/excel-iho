The goal of {ihpdexcel} is to create excel-reports for the International Housing 
Observatory.  It sources an excel template from the `template` dir and store the output 
to `versions` dir, as  "hpta%Year%Quarter.xlsx". It  utilizes the api from `{ihpdr}`, 
to download and tidy data, so there is no need to fetch data manually.

## Download

You can download the whole repo easily with the {usethis} package, just do the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("usethis")
usethis::use_course("kvasilopoulos/ihpdexcel")
```

## Create Excel

Then, source the `create-excel.R` file.

```{r warning=FALSE}
source("create-excel.R")
```

At completion, it will print the name of the file and the relative path.
